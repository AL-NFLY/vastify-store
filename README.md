# Vastify Store
![Website Thumbnail](public/images/hero.png)
An experimental e-commerce project made for me to work with Next.js 14, Shadcn-ui, tRPC, MongoDB & PayloadCMS. This project uses Express.js to decouple the project from Vercel/Next.js environment. Once This project is done, it will replace my [Fragrance Fresh](https://fragrance-fresh.vercel.app/) project.
